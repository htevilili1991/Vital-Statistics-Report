# Executive Summary
Welcome to the First Annual Vital Statistics Report for Vanuatu, a landmark publication by the Vanuatu Bureau of Statistics. This inaugural release represents a significant step forward in our nation's statistical reporting capabilities and our commitment to providing accurate, timely demographic information.

For the first time, we present a comprehensive compilation of vital statistics that captures the fundamental demographic indicators of our nation. This report establishes the baseline for future annual releases and reflects our dedication to maintaining systematic records of Vanuatu's population dynamics. The data used for this report is sourced from the Department of Civil Registration & Identity Management (CRIM) â€“ Birth & Marriage Registration, which is essential for understanding the vital events occurring within our coverage area.

The launch of this annual report series demonstrates our progress in strengthening national statistical systems and aligning with international standards for demographic reporting. It serves as a crucial reference document for government agencies, development partners, researchers, and the public, providing essential data for evidence-based decision-making.

# Completeness

Completeness assesses what proportion of the events (births and deaths) we intended to capture in our coverage area.[^1]

## Completeness of Birth Records

Measuring the completeness of birth registration involves dividing the number of births registered within the year(s) of occurrence by the total estimated number of births for the same period, then multiplying by 100 to express it as a percentage.

The total number of female births in `r first_year` was `r formatC(female_first_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")` and the total number of male births was `r formatC(male_first_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")`.
In `r change_year`, the total number of female births was `r formatC(female_change_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")` and the total number of male births was `r formatC(male_change_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")`.
By `r last_year`, the total number of female births was `r formatC(female_last_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")` and the total number of male births was `r formatC(male_last_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")`.

From `r first_year` to `r last_year`, the total number of female births showed an overall `r if (female_last_year > female_first_year) "increase" else if (female_last_year < female_first_year) "decrease" else "stable trend"`, starting with `r formatC(female_first_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")` in `r first_year` and reaching `r formatC(female_last_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")` in `r last_year`. Similarly, male births displayed an overall `r if (male_last_year > male_first_year) "increase" else if (male_last_year < male_first_year) "decrease" else "stable trend"` over the same period, moving from `r formatC(male_first_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")` to `r formatC(male_last_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")`.

Comparatively, `r if (abs(female_last_year - female_first_year) > abs(male_last_year - male_first_year)) "the growth rate for female births was slightly higher" else if (abs(female_last_year - female_first_year) < abs(male_last_year - male_first_year)) "the growth rate for male births was slightly higher" else "both groups had a similar rate of change"`, indicating a `r if (female_last_year == male_last_year) "converging" else "diverging"` trend by `r last_year`.

## Crude Birth Rate

The Crude Birth Rate (CBR) is a demographic indicator that represents the number of live births occurring in a specific population over a given year, expressed per 1,000 people. It is calculated as the ratio of the total number of births to the total population, multiplied by 1,000.

CBR provides a general measure of birth frequency within a population, helping to assess population growth trends and the reproductive behavior of a society.

## Sex Ratio at Birth

The Sex Ratio at Birth (SRB) is a demographic metric that measures the ratio of male to female live births within a population, typically expressed as the number of male births per 100 female births.

```

The Sex Ratio at Birth in `r first_year` was `r formatC(sex_ratio_first_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")`. By `r last_year`, the Sex Ratio at Birth was `r formatC(sex_ratio_last_year, big.mark = ",", decimal.mark = ".")`.
